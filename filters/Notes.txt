with 12 point smoothing, patches of data are missing. why? should min_periods be set to
6 or something?
It seems min_period=1 or something is necessary.
With min_periods=1, even the edges are having data.

invalid values or nan have to filled somehow before employing loess filter

we can specify and output x grid to deliver estimated y values in loess filter
instead of original xvals

loess filter is used for scatter plots? when both x and y are non linear

loess filter is also an interpolation/extrapolation technique to fill missing values

Simple Moving Average (SMA): SMA may cause edge effects where the
smoothed data near the edges of the signal may be distorted due to unequal weighting.

rolling mean/moving average of a signal (of width w) is equivalent to doing convolution
with a box signal of width w

It can be shown that a convolution in time/space is equivalent to the multiplication 
in the Fourier domain

rectangular smoothing is basic unweighted smoothing
triangle smoothing is basic weighted smoothing

moving average is commonly used for timeseries analysis?
